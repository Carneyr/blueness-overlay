Below are the instructions for preparing either the MySQL or PostgreSQL
database.  Follow the instructions for you setup.

================================================================================

CREATE THE MySQL DATABASE
--------------------------

This step is only necessary if you don't already have a database set-up (e.g. by
your host). In the following examples, 'username' is an example MySQL user which
has the CREATE and GRANT privileges. Use the appropriate user name for your
system.

First, you must create a new database for your Drupal site (here, 'databasename'
is the name of the new database):

  mysqladmin -u username -p create databasename

MySQL will prompt for the 'username' database password and then create the
initial database files. Next you must login and set the access database rights:

  mysql -u username -p

Again, you will be asked for the 'username' database password. At the MySQL
prompt, enter following command:

  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER,
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON databasename.*
  TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

where

 'databasename' is the name of your database
 'username@localhost' is the username of your MySQL account
 'password' is the password required for that username

Note: Unless your database user has all of the privileges listed above, you will
not be able to run Drupal.

If successful, MySQL will reply with:

  Query OK, 0 rows affected

================================================================================

CREATE THE PostgreSQL DATABASE
------------------------------

Note that the database must be created with UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding.

1. CREATE DATABASE USER

   This step is only necessary if you don't already have a user set up (e.g.
   by your host) or you want to create new user for use with Drupal only. The
   following command creates a new user named "username" and asks for a
   password for that user:

     createuser --pwprompt --encrypted --no-adduser --no-createdb username

   If everything works correctly, you'll see a "CREATE USER" notice.

2. CREATE THE DRUPAL DATABASE

   This step is only necessary if you don't already have a database set up (e.g.
   by your host) or you want to create new database for use with Drupal only.
   The following command creates a new database named "databasename", which is
   owned by previously created "username":

     createdb --encoding=UNICODE --owner=username databasename

   If everything works correctly, you'll see a "CREATE DATABASE" notice.
